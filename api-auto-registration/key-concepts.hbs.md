# Key Concepts for API Auto Registration

This topic explains key concepts you use with API Auto Registration.

## <a id='architecture'></a>API Auto Registration Architecture

You can use the full potential of API Auto Registration by using a distributed environment,
like the one in this diagram:

## <a id='api-descriptor'></a>APIDescriptor Custom Resource Explained

To use API Auto Registration, you must create a custom resource of type `APIDescriptor`.
The information from this custom resource constructs an API entity in Tanzu Developer Portal.

This custom resource exposes the following text boxes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: APIDescriptor
metadata:
  name:                   # name of your APIDescriptor
  namespace:              # optional namespace of your APIDescriptor
spec:
  type:                   # type of the API spec. oneOf(openapi, grpc, asyncapi, graphql)
  description:            # description for the API exposed
  system:                 # system that the API is part of
  owner:                  # person/team that owns the API
  location:
    apiSpec:
      path:               # sub-path where the API spec is available (previously `location.path`)
      url:                # (Optional) static absolute base URL for the API spec
    server:               # base URL object where the API spec is available. oneOf(url, ref) (previously `location.baseURL`)
      url:                # (Optional) static absolute base URL for the API server
      ref:                # (Optional) object ref to oneOf(HTTPProxy, Knative Service, Ingress)
        apiVersion:
        kind:
        name:
        namespace:
```

The text boxes cause specific behavior in Tanzu Developer Portal:

- The system and owner are copied to the API entity. You might have to separately create and add the
  [System](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#kind-system) and
  [Group](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#kind-group) kind to
  the catalog.
- Tanzu Developer Portal uses the namespace for the API entity where the APIDescriptor CR is applied.
  This causes the API entity's name, system, and owner to all be in that namespace.
- To explicitly use a system or owner in a different namespace, you can specify that in the
  `system: my-namespace/my-other-system` or `owner: my-namespace/my-other-team` text boxes.
- If the system or owner you are trying to link doesn't have a namespace specified, you can qualify
  them with the `default` namespace. For example, `system: default/my-default-system`

>**Important** `spec.location.path` is now deprecated in favor of `spec.location.apiSpec.path`, and
`spec.location.baseURL` is now deprecated in favor of `spec.location.server`. This change supports
having a different API server location from the specifications location.
These deprecated fields will be removed in Tanzu Application Platform 1.8.

### <a id='absolute-url'></a>With an Absolute URL

To create an APIDescriptor with a static `server.url`, you must apply the following YAML to your cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: APIDescriptor
metadata:
  name: sample-absolute-url
spec:
  type: openapi
  description: A set of API endpoints to manage the resources within the petclinic app.
  system: spring-petclinic
  owner: team-petclinic
  location:
    apiSpec:
      path: "/v3/api-docs.yaml"
    server:
      url: https://myservice.mynamespace.svc.cluster.local:6789
```

### <a id='with-ref'></a>With an Object Ref

You can use an object reference, instead of hard coding the URL, to point to a HTTPProxy, Knative
Service, or Ingress.
VMware does not support referencing Kubernetes `Service` with Object Ref. To point to your Kubernetes
`Service` directly, you can use the static URL with cluster DNS address instead. For example, `https://myservice.mynamespace.svc.cluster.local:6789`.

#### <a id='with-httpproxy-ref'></a>With an HTTPPRoxy Object Ref

This section includes an example YAML that points to an HTTPProxy from which the controller extracts
the `.spec.virtualhost.fqdn` as the baseURL.

```yaml
apiVersion: apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: APIDescriptor
metadata:
  name: sample-contour-ref
spec:
  type: openapi
  description: A set of API endpoints to manage the resources within the petclinic app.
  system: spring-petclinic
  owner: team-petclinic
  location:
    apiSpec:
      path: "/test/openapi"
    server:
      ref:
        apiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1
        kind: HTTPProxy
        name: my-httpproxy
        namespace: my-namespace # optional
```

#### <a id='with-knative-ref'></a>With a Knative Service Object Ref

To use a Knative Service, your controller reads the `status.url` as the baseURL. For example:

```yaml
# all other fields similar to the above example
    server:
      ref:
        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Service
        name: my-knative-service
        namespace: my-namespace # optional
```

#### <a id='with-ingress-ref'></a>With an Ingress Object Ref

To use an Ingress instead, your controller reads the URL from the jsonPath specified. When jsonPath
is left empty, your controller reads the `"{.spec.rules[0].host}"` as the URL. For example:

```yaml
# all other fields similar to the above example
    server:
      ref:
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        name: my-ingress
        jsonPath: "{.spec.rules[1].host}"
        namespace: my-namespace # optional
```

### <a id='status-fields'></a>APIDescriptor Status Fields

When processing an APIDescriptor several fields are added to the `status`. One of these is `conditons`,
which provide information useful for troubleshooting. The conditions are explained in the
[Troubleshooting Guide](../api-auto-registration/troubleshooting.hbs.md).

In addition to `conditions` the `status` contains a couple of other useful fields. The following is
a list of these fields with a brief explanation of what they contain.

```yaml
status:
  registeredEntityURL:    # Url of the corresponding API Entity in Tanzu Developer Portal
  registeredTapUID:       # Unique identifier for the corresponding API Entity in Tanzu Developer Portal
  resolvedAPIServerURL:   # Url to the API runtime server
  resolvedAPISpecURL:     # Url used to retrieve the full API Spec by Api Auto Registration
  resolvedAPISpec:        # Full API Spec as retrieved by Api Auto Registration
  resolvedAPISpecHash:    # Hash value of the `resolvedAPISpec`. This field can be used to see whether the spec has been updated or not.
  APISpecLastUpdateTime:  # Timestamp representing the server time when API Spec was last updated. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.
```

## <a id='curated-api-descriptor'></a>CuratedAPIDescriptor Custom Resource Explained

To curate one or more Workload OpenAPI specifications into a single aggregated API,
you may create a custom resource of type `CuratedAPIDescriptor`.
The information from this custom resource references a list of APIDescriptors and how they should
be aggregated together through path-based routing.

If a valid route provider is specified, e.g. `spring-cloud-gateway` for
[Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes](../spring-cloud-gateway/about.hbs.md) (SCG for short),
the API Auto Registration controller will find the [SpringCloudGateway (SCG)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes/2.1/scg-k8s/GUID-developer-resources-springcloudgateway.html)
resource and automatically creates the following routing resources for you to expose your curated APIs
as one:

- [SpringCloudGatewayRouteConfig (SCGRC)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes/2.1/scg-k8s/GUID-developer-resources-springcloudgatewayrouteconfig.html):
  a custom resource that describes all the API endpoints and optional routing modifiers to access
  the endpoints. This is generated from the resolved OpenAPI Specification of the APIDescriptor
  through [SCG OpenAPI conversion service](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes/2.1/scg-k8s/GUID-guides-openapi-route-conversion.html).
- [SpringCloudGatewayMapping (SCGM)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes/2.1/scg-k8s/GUID-developer-resources-springcloudgatewaymapping.html):
  a custom resource that binds a SCGRC resource to a SCG resource.

This custom resource exposes the following text boxes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: CuratedAPIDescriptor
metadata:
  name:                 # name of your CuratedAPIDescriptor
  namespace:            # optional namespace of your CuratedAPIDescriptor
  annotations:
    "apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/route-provider": "spring-cloud-gateway"   # specify route provider
spec:
  type: openapi         # type of the API spec. oneOf(openapi, grpc, asyncapi, graphql)
  title:                # title of the curated API
  description:          # description of the curated API
  documentation:        # TODO
  groupId:              # groupID of the curated API.
  version:              # version of the curated API
  apiDescriptors:
    - name:             # name of a APIDescriptor to include in this curated API
      namespace:        # optional namespace of the APIDescriptor
      pathPrefix:       # Path prefix that the API endpoints from the linked APIDescriptor should have
      routeConfig:
        ssoEnabled:     # whether to enable SSO on the gateway to perform authentication for users
        filters:        # additional service lever filters to set on all the endpoints in this API
    - ...
```

More detailed explanation on some of the key text boxes:

- The `apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/route-provider` annotation specified how you want to provide routing
  to the curated API. We currently only support `spring-cloud-gateway`.
- `groupId` is a concept that's aligned with [API portal](../api-portal/about.hbs.md) to group APIs
  from different high-availability zones/locations and/or with different `version`s.
- `groupId` and `version` is used to identify a matching gateway that will be routing traffic for the
  curated API
- `routeConfig` section specifies service level configuration we should add when generating the routing
  resource for the API. Please refer to [this page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes2.1/scg-k8s/GUID-guides-openapi-route-conversion.html#providing-service-level-filters)
  for more details on each field for spring-cloud-gateway.

### <a id='curated-status-fields'></a>CuratedAPIDescriptor Status Fields

When processing an CuratedAPIDescriptor several fields are added to the `status`. One of these is `conditons`,
which provide information useful for troubleshooting. The conditions are explained in the
[Troubleshooting Guide](../api-auto-registration/troubleshooting.hbs.md).

In addition to `conditions` the `status` contains a couple of other useful fields. The following is
a list of these fields with a brief explanation of what they contain.

```yaml
status:
  ResolvedBaseURL:        # Base url to access the curated API. Empty if no route provider is configured.
  ResolvedAPISpecURL:     # Url to the generated aggregated API spec
  AggregatedAPISpec:      # Generated full API Spec as aggregated by Api Auto Registration
  AggregatedAPISpecHash:  # Hash of the aggregated API Spec. This field can be used to see whether the spec has been updated or not.
  LastUpdateTime:         # Timestamp representing the server time when API Spec was last updated. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.
  MatchedGateway:         # The Gateway resource the curated API is matched on. We currently only support SCG.
```
